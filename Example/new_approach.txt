New approach:
- Consider the context around the line, since I would hypothesize that
tokens in the line have high local context, meaning that surrounding
lines would use similar tokens. Therefore helping us to determine
the location.

- Give keywords in Java more weight, e.g. if statement should be replaced
with other if statement. Does this mean stopwords matters?

- If a line is just an extension/reduction of another line, e.g
if(length == 0) -> if(length == 0 || list.isEmpty()). This should
be more similar

- Use ensemble methods.
