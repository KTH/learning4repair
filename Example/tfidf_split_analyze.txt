String similarity maybe will help?

/Users/zimin/Desktop/KTH/Master-Thesis/one-liner-competition.nosync/Datasets/Dataset2/Tasks/10932.txt
Very hard

/Users/zimin/Desktop/KTH/Master-Thesis/one-liner-competition.nosync/Datasets/Dataset2/Tasks/10980.txt
Very hard

/Users/zimin/Desktop/KTH/Master-Thesis/one-liner-competition.nosync/Datasets/Dataset1/Tasks/3537.txt
Embedding would help

/Users/zimin/Desktop/KTH/Master-Thesis/one-liner-competition.nosync/Datasets/Dataset2/Tasks/4340.txt
Edit distance or some kind of string similarity would work

/Users/zimin/Desktop/KTH/Master-Thesis/one-liner-competition.nosync/Datasets/Dataset2/Tasks/8797.txt
The idea of context should work

Showing that tfidf give too much weight to uncommon tokens

Embedding would help

/Users/zimin/Desktop/KTH/Master-Thesis/one-liner-competition.nosync/Datasets/Dataset2/Tasks/2870.txt
Too many similar pairs, very hard

Shows the importance of comparing structure instead of tfidf.
Context might help as well!

Split will ignore {}, that is why. using javalang will solve this problem

/Users/zimin/Desktop/KTH/Master-Thesis/one-liner-competition.nosync/Datasets/Dataset2/Tasks/2079.txt
Comment should weight less?

/Users/zimin/Desktop/KTH/Master-Thesis/one-liner-competition.nosync/Datasets/Dataset2/Tasks/3745.txt
javalang will probability solve this, comparing structure also important

/Users/zimin/Desktop/KTH/Master-Thesis/one-liner-competition.nosync/Datasets/Dataset2/Tasks/7339.txt
Split will ignore +, javalang will solve this. And embedding of "" and '' should be close.
javalang + embedding maybe

Structure matters! In this case, number of input arguments.
Split will ignore };, javalang will solve this. And structure matters.

Don't really understand, seems like tfidf_split should solve this.
